ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) does not handle cases where the sum of a and b exceeds the maximum value for an int, possibly leading to integer overflow.
Solution: Implement input validation to check if the sum exceeds the range of int. Consider using long or BigInteger for operations expected to exceed the integer limits.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function assumes valid input without any validation. Malicious input could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure the inputs are within expected bounds and handle any illegal arguments appropriately.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:
  TestName: testBasicAddition
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of adding two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integer variables, `a` and `b`.
  Act: Call `addTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum of `a` and `b`.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method correctly computes the sum of two positive integers. It is significant as it ensures the primary functionality of the method works as expected.

### Scenario 2: Addition with Zero
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test checks the method's response when one of the integers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define integers `a = 5` and `b = 0`.
  Act: Call `addTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to `a`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that adding zero to any number returns the number itself, which is a fundamental property of addition. It confirms the method handles zero correctly.

### Scenario 3: Negative Numbers Addition
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeNumbersAddition
  Description: This test checks the addition of two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integers, `a` and `b`.
  Act: Call `addTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected negative sum.
Validation:
  This test checks that the method can handle negative numbers and correctly compute their sum, which is crucial for applications dealing with a range of integer inputs.

### Scenario 4: Mixed Sign Numbers Addition
Details:
  TestName: testMixedSignNumbersAddition
  Description: This test evaluates the addition of one positive and one negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive integer `a` and a negative integer `b`.
  Act: Call `addTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the algebraic sum of `a` and `b`.
Validation:
  Verifying the addition of mixed-sign numbers ensures that the method correctly handles different signs, which is important for accurate arithmetic operations in diverse scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Large Numbers Addition
Details:
  TestName: testLargeNumbersAddition
  Description: This test checks the addition operation with large integer values to ensure no overflow errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two large integers `a` and `b` close to the maximum value of integers.
  Act: Call `addTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if the method handles or throws an exception in case of overflow.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the addition method under extreme conditions, ensuring that the application behaves predictably with large inputs or gracefully handles arithmetic overflow.

### Scenario 6: Input Invariants
Details:
  TestName: testInputInvariants
  Description: This test verifies that the inputs to the method are not altered after the operation, preserving data integrity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize integers `a` and `b` with specific values.
  Act: Store copies of `a` and `b`, call `addTwoNumbers(a, b)`, and compare the original variables with their copies.
  Assert: Ensure that the original values of `a` and `b` are unchanged.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the method does not modify its input parameters is crucial for maintaining data integrity across the application, especially in functions meant only to compute and return results based on the provided inputs.
