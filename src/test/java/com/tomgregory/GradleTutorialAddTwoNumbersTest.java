ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) does not handle cases where the sum of a and b exceeds the maximum value for an int, possibly leading to integer overflow.
Solution: Implement input validation to check if the sum exceeds the range of int. Alternatively, use a larger data type like long or BigInteger for operations expected to exceed the limits of int.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method does not validate the input values which may lead to unexpected behavior if incorrect values are used.
Solution: Add checks to ensure the inputs meet the method's expected logical constraints and preconditions. For example, if negative values are not expected, validate that both inputs are non-negative.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:
  TestName: testBasicAddition
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of adding two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integer values.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these two integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the sum of these two integers.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the sum matches the expected result. This is significant as it validates the correctness of the basic addition operation, which is fundamental to the method's purpose.

### Scenario 2: Addition with Zero
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test verifies that adding zero to any number returns the original number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer and zero.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with the integer and zero.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the original integer.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that adding zero does not change the value, which is an important property of addition in mathematics and must be maintained by the method.

### Scenario 3: Addition of Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test checks the method's ability to correctly add two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the sum of these two integers.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method handles negative values correctly, which is crucial for its applicability to a range of mathematical operations involving negative numbers.

### Scenario 4: Addition Resulting in Overflow
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionResultingInOverflow
  Description: This test checks how the method handles integer overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two integers that when added result in overflow.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.
  Assert: Check the result to see if it handles overflow as expected (typically by wrapping around in Java).
Validation:
  The assertion checks overflow behavior. It's significant because it tests the robustness of the method in extreme cases, ensuring it behaves consistently with Java's rules for integer overflow.

### Scenario 5: Addition of Maximum Integers
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaximumIntegers
  Description: Verify that adding two maximum integer values handles overflow correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use Integer.MAX_VALUE for both parameters.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method.
  Assert: Check if the result is as expected with integer overflow.
Validation:
  Validates that the method deals correctly with the edge case of maximum integer values, important for understanding boundary behaviors in the application.

### Scenario 6: Addition of One Positive and One Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegative
  Description: This test ensures the method can correctly add a positive number to a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the correct sum, accounting for the signs.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the correctness of addition across different signs, which is critical for ensuring the method's accuracy in diverse scenarios.
