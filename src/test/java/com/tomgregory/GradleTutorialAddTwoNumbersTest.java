ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) does not handle cases where the sum of a and b exceeds the maximum value for an int, possibly leading to integer overflow.
Solution: Implement input validation to check if the sum exceeds the range of int. Alternatively, use a larger data type like long or BigInteger for operations expected to exceed the limits of int.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method does not validate the input values which may lead to unexpected behavior if the method is used with invalid or unintended input values.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure the values of a and b are within expected bounds. Consider throwing IllegalArgumentException if the inputs are not valid.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Test addition of two positive integers

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveIntegers  
Description: This test checks the addition of two positive integers to ensure the method correctly computes the sum.  

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two positive integer values.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with the two positive integers.  
Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum of the two integers.  

Validation:  
The assertion confirms that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. This is fundamental for ensuring the calculator's accuracy in basic arithmetic operations.

---

### Scenario 2: Test addition of two negative integers

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeIntegers  
Description: This test checks the addition of two negative integers to verify that the method handles negative values correctly.  

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two negative integer values.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with the two negative integers.  
Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum, which should also be negative.  

Validation:  
The assertion checks that negative numbers are added correctly, which is significant for applications requiring operations involving debts or other negative values.

---

### Scenario 3: Test addition of a positive integer and a negative integer

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeInteger  
Description: This test ensures that the method can correctly add a positive integer and a negative integer.  

Execution:  
Arrange: Define a positive integer and a negative integer.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Verify that the result is the difference between the two numbers, reflecting correct addition of mixed sign integers.  

Validation:  
This test is crucial for confirming that the method accurately processes sums involving mixed-sign operands, a common scenario in financial calculations.

---

### Scenario 4: Test addition of zero with another integer

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionWithZero  
Description: This test verifies that adding zero to any integer returns the integer itself, as zero is the identity element in addition.  

Execution:  
Arrange: Define zero and another integer.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with zero and the integer.  
Assert: Check that the result is the same as the non-zero integer.  

Validation:  
Asserting that the sum with zero returns the original number confirms the method's compliance with the identity property of addition, which is vital for ensuring mathematical accuracy.

---

### Scenario 5: Test addition resulting in overflow

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionResultingInOverflow  
Description: This test checks how the method handles integer overflow, which can occur when summing two large integers.  

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two large integers close to the maximum value for integers.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Verify that the result wraps around according to Java's integer overflow behavior.  

Validation:  
The assertion checks for correct behavior under overflow conditions, which is important for applications where large integer calculations are common, helping to identify potential issues in handling extreme values.
