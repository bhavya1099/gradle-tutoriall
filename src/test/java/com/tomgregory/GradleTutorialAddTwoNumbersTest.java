================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) may lead to an integer overflow if the sum of 'a' and 'b' exceeds the maximum value for an integer (2^31 - 1).
Solution: Validate the input values to ensure they are within a safe range before performing the addition. Consider using a larger data type like long, or throw an exception if the sum exceeds the integer range.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without input validation, the function can be misused or trigger unexpected behavior when handling malicious input values.
Solution: Implement input checks to validate the range and type of 'a' and 'b'. For critical applications, consider logging input values to detect potential abuse or errors.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Implicit conversions or incorrect handling of numeric types could lead to precision loss or calculation errors.
Solution: Explicitly handle numeric conversions and ensure that operations are safe and appropriate for the expected data types. Consider using exact arithmetic APIs if precision is critical.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Test addition of two positive integers

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveIntegers  
Description: This test checks the addition of two positive integers to ensure the method correctly computes the sum.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two positive integer values.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with the two positive integers.  
Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum of the two integers.  
Validation:  
The assertion validates that the sum of two positive integers is computed correctly. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the addition operation within expected normal operational parameters.

### Scenario 2: Test addition of two negative integers

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeIntegers  
Description: This test verifies the method's capability to handle the addition of two negative integers, ensuring the result is the correct negative value.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two negative integer values.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with these values.  
Assert: Check that the output is the correct sum, which should also be negative.  
Validation:  
This test confirms that the method can correctly add negative numbers, which is crucial for scenarios involving negative inputs.

### Scenario 3: Test addition of a positive and a negative integer

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeInteger  
Description: This test evaluates the addition of one positive and one negative integer, ensuring correct computation when the inputs have different signs.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define one positive and one negative integer.  
Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Verify that the result is the algebraic sum of the two values.  
Validation:  
Ensures that the method correctly handles inputs of different signs, a common scenario in many computational tasks.

### Scenario 4: Test addition resulting in zero

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionResultingInZero  
Description: This test checks if the addition of two integers that should algebraically sum to zero is handled correctly.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set one positive and one negative integer whose sum is zero.  
Act: Use the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Confirm that the resulting sum is zero.  
Validation:  
This test verifies that the method correctly handles cases where the sum results in zero, ensuring the method's reliability in edge cases.

### Scenario 5: Test addition with zero

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionWithZero  
Description: Tests the method's behavior when one of the operands is zero, which should not affect the sum.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define a non-zero integer and zero.  
Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with these values.  
Assert: Check that the output equals the non-zero integer.  
Validation:  
This scenario confirms that adding zero to any number returns the number itself, an important aspect of additive identity in arithmetic.

### Scenario 6: Test addition of maximum integer values

Details:  
TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntValues  
Description: Tests how the method handles the addition of two maximum integer values, checking for potential overflow issues.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Use the maximum value for integers (Integer.MAX_VALUE) for both operands.  
Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these maximum values.  
Assert: Observe whether the method handles integer overflow as expected (typically resulting in a negative number due to overflow).  
Validation:  
This test is critical for understanding the method's behavior under extreme conditions, essential for ensuring robustness in high-range numerical operations.
