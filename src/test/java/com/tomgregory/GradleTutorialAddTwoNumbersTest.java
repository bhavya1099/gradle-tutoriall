================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) can lead to an integer overflow if the sum of a and b exceeds the maximum value for an int (2147483647). This could result in incorrect calculations or unexpected behaviors.
Solution: To mitigate this vulnerability, consider checking for integer overflow before performing the addition, or use a larger data type like long for operations that could exceed the int range.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method does not validate that the inputs are within an expected range, which could lead to errors if the method is used with invalid input values.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the provided integers meet the method's requirements or expectations. This could include checking that the inputs are within a specific range or that they are not negative if only positive numbers are expected.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:  
  TestName: testBasicAddition  
  Description: Test the addition of two positive integers to verify if the method correctly computes their sum.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., 5 and 7.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these integers.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is 12.  
Validation:  
  This assertion validates that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. It confirms the method's ability to handle typical addition scenarios and produce accurate results.

### Scenario 2: Addition with Zero
Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero  
  Description: Test adding zero to another number to check if the method returns the other number unchanged.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Provide a positive integer, e.g., 5, and zero.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these numbers.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is 5.  
Validation:  
  This test ensures that adding zero to any number does not change the original number, which is a fundamental property of addition. This scenario is significant for validating the correctness of the method in edge cases.

### Scenario 3: Negative Numbers Addition
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeNumbersAddition  
  Description: Verify the method's ability to correctly add two negative numbers.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., -3 and -7.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these integers.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is -10.  
Validation:  
  This test confirms that the method can accurately handle addition where both operands are negative, ensuring the method's reliability across different numeric conditions.

### Scenario 4: Mixed Sign Numbers Addition
Details:  
  TestName: testMixedSignNumbersAddition  
  Description: Test the addition of one positive and one negative number to ensure correct computation.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare a positive integer, e.g., 5, and a negative integer, e.g., -3.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these integers.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is 2.  
Validation:  
  This test checks if the method accurately computes results for numbers with different signs, which is crucial for correct arithmetic operations in real-world applications.

### Scenario 5: Large Numbers Addition
Details:  
  TestName: testLargeNumbersAddition  
  Description: Verify that the method can handle the addition of two very large integers correctly.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare two large integers, e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE and 1.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these integers.  
  Assert: Check for correct behavior or overflow.  
Validation:  
  This scenario tests the method's behavior when handling large values that might cause an overflow, highlighting its reliability and robustness in extreme cases.

### Scenario 6: Identity Property of Addition
Details:  
  TestName: testIdentityPropertyOfAddition  
  Description: Verify that adding zero to any number returns the original number, confirming the identity property of addition.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare an arbitrary integer, e.g., 42, and zero.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these numbers.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is 42.  
Validation:  
  This test is crucial to confirm that the addition method adheres to the identity property of addition, which is a basic expectation in arithmetic operations.
