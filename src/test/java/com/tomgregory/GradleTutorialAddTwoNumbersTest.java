================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) does not handle cases where the sum of a and b exceeds the maximum value for an int, possibly leading to integer overflow.
Solution: Implement input validation to check if the sum exceeds the range of int. Alternatively, use a larger data type like long or BigInteger for operations expected to exceed the limits of int.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method does not validate the input values which may lead to unexpected behavior if incorrect values are used.
Solution: Add checks to ensure the inputs meet the expected format or range before performing operations on them.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:  
  TestName: testBasicAddition  
  Description: Test the addition of two positive integers to verify if the method correctly computes their sum.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., 5 and 7.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these integers.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is 12.  
Validation:  
  This assertion validates that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. It confirms the method's ability to handle typical addition operations, ensuring basic arithmetic functionality.

### Scenario 2: Addition With Zero
Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero  
  Description: Test the addition of a number and zero to check if the method returns the original number unchanged.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare an integer and zero, e.g., 5 and 0.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these values.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is 5.  
Validation:  
  This test checks if adding zero to a number results in the number itself, which is a fundamental property of addition. This ensures the method handles cases involving zero correctly.

### Scenario 3: Addition With Negative Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithNegativeNumbers  
  Description: Verify the method's behavior when adding two negative integers.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., -5 and -3.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these integers.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is -8.  
Validation:  
  This assertion checks the method's ability to correctly add negative numbers, which is crucial for ensuring full arithmetic support.

### Scenario 4: Addition Resulting in Overflow
Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionResultingInOverflow  
  Description: Test the method's response to integer overflow by adding two large integers.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare two large integers, e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE and 1.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these integers.  
  Assert: Check for an appropriate response, possibly catching an exception or checking the result for overflow indication.  
Validation:  
  This test checks how the method handles situations where the result exceeds the maximum value storable in an integer. It's significant for understanding the method's reliability and correctness under extreme conditions.

### Scenario 5: Symmetric Addition
Details:  
  TestName: testSymmetricAddition  
  Description: Ensure the addition is commutative, meaning the order of operands does not affect the result.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Prepare two integers, e.g., 5 and 9.  
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method first with (5, 9) and then with (9, 5).  
  Assert: Assert that both results are equal and correct (14).  
Validation:  
  This test verifies the commutative property of addition within the method, ensuring that the order of parameters does not impact the outcome. This is crucial for confirming the fundamental properties of addition.

These scenarios comprehensively test the addTwoNumbers method across typical, boundary, and special cases, ensuring robustness and correctness in its implementation.
