ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) does not handle cases where the sum of a and b exceeds the maximum value for an int, possibly leading to integer overflow.
Solution: Implement input validation to check if the sum exceeds the range of int. Consider using long or BigInteger for operations expected to exceed the integer limits.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function assumes that input parameters are always valid integers without any validation. This might lead to unexpected behavior if the method is manipulated with non-integer inputs or used inappropriately.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that the provided inputs are within acceptable ranges and types before performing operations.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:
  TestName: testBasicAddition
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of adding two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integer values.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these two integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the sum of these two integers.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the sum matches the expected result. This is significant as it validates the method's ability to handle straightforward addition, which is its primary functionality.

### Scenario 2: Addition with Zero
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test verifies that adding zero to any number returns the original number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer and zero.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with the integer and zero.
  Assert: Check if the result equals the original integer.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that adding zero does not change the value, which is a fundamental property of addition. This ensures the method correctly handles cases involving zero.

### Scenario 3: Addition with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: Checks the addition operation when both operands are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the output is the correct sum, which should also be negative.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method can handle negative numbers correctly, which is crucial for its reliability across different numerical inputs.

### Scenario 4: Addition with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithLargeNumbers
  Description: Tests the method's ability to handle very large integers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose two large integers close to the maximum value for integers.
  Act: Invoke the `addTwoNumbers` method with these large numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is correct or that the method handles potential overflow appropriately.
Validation:
  This test checks robustness and correctness under extreme conditions, ensuring that the method is reliable even with large values.

### Scenario 5: Mixed Sign Addition
Details:
  TestName: testMixedSignAddition
  Description: Verify that the method correctly adds numbers where one is negative and the other is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these two numbers.
  Assert: Ensure the result is the arithmetic sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles cases where operands have different signs, which is important for accurate computation in diverse scenarios.

### Scenario 6: Addition Resulting in Zero
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionResultingInZero
  Description: Checks if the addition of two specific integers that should sum to zero is handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two integers that are negatives of each other.
  Act: Call the `addTwoNumbers` method with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can accurately sum to zero when required, which is an important aspect of handling balanced transactions or adjustments in computations.
