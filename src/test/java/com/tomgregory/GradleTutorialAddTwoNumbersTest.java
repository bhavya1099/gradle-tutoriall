================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Issue: When adding two large integers, the result can overflow the maximum value representable by an int, leading to incorrect results and potentially causing application logic errors.
Solution: Use java.math.BigInteger for operations that could exceed the range of int or long data types. Alternatively, validate input values to ensure they are within a safe range before performing arithmetic operations.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The method addTwoNumbers does not perform any checks on the values of 'a' and 'b'. Malicious input or unexpected data types can cause the application to behave unpredictably or crash.
Solution: Implement input validation to check the type and range of 'a' and 'b'. Consider using assertions or throwing IllegalArgumentException if the input does not meet the required criteria.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Error Handling
Issue: The method does not handle scenarios where arithmetic operations could lead to exceptions or erroneous states, such as overflow.
Solution: Add error handling mechanisms to catch and manage potential arithmetic exceptions or define a clear method contract regarding input constraints.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:
  TestName: testBasicAddition
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the addTwoNumbers method by adding two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integer variables with positive values.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these variables.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers. This test is essential to ensure that the basic arithmetic operation of addition is implemented correctly.

### Scenario 2: Addition with Zero
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the addTwoNumbers method when one of the operands is zero, which should not affect the sum.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one integer as zero and another with a positive value.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these variables.
  Assert: Assert that the result equals the non-zero operand.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that adding zero to any number returns the number itself. It is crucial for validating the identity property of addition.

### Scenario 3: Negative Numbers Addition
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeNumbersAddition
  Description: This test verifies that the addTwoNumbers method correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integer variables with negative values.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these variables.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected negative sum.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle negative numbers and still perform addition correctly, which is important for comprehensive arithmetic operation coverage.

### Scenario 4: Mixed Sign Numbers Addition
Details:
  TestName: testMixedSignNumbersAddition
  Description: This test checks the addition of two integers where one is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one integer with a positive value and another with a negative value.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these variables.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the algebraic sum of the two values.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly handles numbers with different signs, ensuring accurate results in scenarios involving debt, credits, or other mixed-sign arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 5: Large Numbers Addition
Details:
  TestName: testLargeNumbersAddition
  Description: This test is to verify that the addTwoNumbers method can handle large integers and provide the correct sum without overflow errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integers close to the maximum value for integers.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these variables.
  Assert: Carefully check for overflow and that the result is correct.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the method when dealing with large values, which is crucial for applications requiring high-range numerical computations.

### Scenario 6: Addition Resulting in Zero
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionResultingInZero
  Description: This test verifies that adding two numbers where one is the negation of the other results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one integer to a positive value and the other to the negative of that value.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these variables.
  Assert: Assert that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms the method's ability to correctly sum to zero when required, which is important for scenarios involving reversals or cancellations in financial or computational operations.
