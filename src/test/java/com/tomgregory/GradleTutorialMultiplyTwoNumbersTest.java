================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) can lead to integer overflow if the product of a and b exceeds the maximum value that an int can store, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or system instability.
Solution: Consider checking the values of a and b before multiplication or use a data type with a larger range, such as long, to handle larger numbers. Additionally, you might implement input validation or use BigInteger for handling very large numbers safely.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: If the method multiplyTwoNumbers is exposed to user input without proper validation, it can be used inappropriately or maliciously, especially if it is part of a public API or web service.
Solution: Ensure that all user inputs are validated before being passed to this method. Consider making the method private or final if it does not need to be exposed or overridden, reducing the attack surface.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper input validation, passing unexpected or malicious data to multiplyTwoNumbers could lead to unexpected behavior or errors that could be exploited in certain contexts.
Solution: Implement robust input validation to ensure that only valid integers are processed. Use try-catch blocks to handle any arithmetic exceptions that may occur, and log these events for further analysis.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Multiply two positive integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two positive integers. It ensures that the method correctly multiplies two positive values.  
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define two positive integer values, e.g., `a = 5` and `b = 3`.
  - Act: Call `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is `15`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion checks that the product of 5 and 3 is correctly computed as 15. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of multiplication for positive numbers.

### Scenario 2: Multiply two negative integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test verifies the multiplication of two negative integers. It checks if the method correctly handles negative values.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define two negative integer values, e.g., `a = -4` and `b = -6`.
  - Act: Call `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is `24`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion confirms that the product of -4 and -6 is correctly computed as 24. This test is important for ensuring that the multiplication logic correctly handles negative values.

### Scenario 3: Multiply a positive integer by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveByZero  
Description: This test checks the result when a positive integer is multiplied by zero, which should always result in zero.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define a positive integer `a = 7` and `b = 0`.
  - Act: Call `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is `0`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion verifies that any number multiplied by zero results in zero. This test is crucial for confirming correct behavior when multiplying by zero.

### Scenario 4: Multiply a negative integer by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeByZero  
Description: This test checks the result when a negative integer is multiplied by zero, which should always result in zero.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define a negative integer `a = -8` and `b = 0`.
  - Act: Call `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is `0`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion ensures that multiplying a negative number by zero results in zero. This test is essential for validating the correct handling of zero in multiplication.

### Scenario 5: Multiply two numbers where one is negative and the other is positive
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveAndNegative  
Description: This test verifies the multiplication of a positive number by a negative number, expecting a negative result.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define `a = 9` and `b = -2`.
  - Act: Call `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is `-18`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion checks that the product of 9 and -2 is -18, confirming that the method correctly handles multiplication involving both positive and negative numbers. This test is significant as it ensures the method correctly interprets sign operations.
