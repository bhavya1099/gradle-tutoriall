================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) can lead to integer overflow if the product of a and b exceeds the maximum value that an int can store, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or system instability.
Solution: Consider checking the values of a and b before multiplication or use a data type with a larger range, such as long, to store the result. Additionally, you could use Java's Math.multiplyExact(int x, int y) which throws ArithmeticException on overflow to safely handle overflows.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Implicit conversion in the method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) might not be safe if the values of a or b are provided from untrusted sources, as it might lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Explicitly handle type conversions and validate all inputs. Using safe conversion methods or libraries can also help in preventing type-related issues.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: If the method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) is used in security-critical contexts, such as calculating memory allocation sizes, timeouts, or other resource-related decisions, relying on untrusted input can lead to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs to security-sensitive methods are validated, sanitized, or derived from trusted sources. Implement input validation frameworks or utilize existing Java security libraries to enforce input integrity.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Multiply two positive integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two positive integers. It ensures that the method correctly multiplies two positive values.  
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define two positive integer values, `a = 5` and `b = 3`.
  - Act: Invoke `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Assert that the result is `15`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion verifies that the product of 5 and 3 is correctly calculated as 15. This confirms that the method handles standard positive integer multiplication correctly.

### Scenario 2: Multiply two negative integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two negative integers. It ensures that the method correctly multiplies two negative values and returns a positive result.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define two negative integer values, `a = -4` and `b = -2`.
  - Act: Invoke `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Assert that the result is `8`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion verifies that the product of -4 and -2 results in 8. This test is significant as it confirms the multiplication rule for negatives, where the result should be positive.

### Scenario 3: Multiply a positive integer by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveByZero  
Description: This test verifies that multiplying any positive integer by zero results in zero, confirming the zero multiplication property.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define `a = 7` and `b = 0`.
  - Act: Invoke `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Assert that the result is `0`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion checks that multiplying 7 by 0 yields 0. This is crucial for ensuring the method adheres to fundamental arithmetic rules regarding zero.

### Scenario 4: Multiply a negative integer by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeByZero  
Description: This test checks that multiplying any negative integer by zero results in zero.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define `a = -5` and `b = 0`.
  - Act: Invoke `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Assert that the result is `0`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion confirms that the product of -5 and 0 is 0. It's important to verify that the zero property holds true regardless of the sign of the other operand.

### Scenario 5: Multiply two integers where one is negative
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveByNegative  
Description: This test ensures that multiplying a positive integer by a negative integer yields a negative result.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define `a = 6` and `b = -3`.
  - Act: Invoke `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Assert that the result is `-18`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion checks that 6 multiplied by -3 results in -18. This test is essential to ensure that the method correctly handles scenarios involving mixed signs, resulting in a negative product.

### Scenario 6: Multiply two large integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyLargeNumbers  
Description: This test verifies that the method can handle the multiplication of two large integers without overflow.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Define `a = 100000` and `b = 30000`.
  - Act: Invoke `multiplyTwoNumbers(a, b)`.
  - Assert: Assert that the result is `3000000000`.
Validation: 
  - The assertion validates the product of two large numbers, ensuring that the method manages large values and avoids integer overflow within the limits of Java's `int` type. This is significant for applications requiring high-range numerical computations.
