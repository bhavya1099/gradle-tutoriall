================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) can lead to integer overflow if the product of a and b exceeds the maximum value that a Java int can store.
Solution: Consider using a data type with a larger range such as long, or implement input validation to ensure the values of a and b are within a safe range before multiplication.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Lack of input validation allows for the method to process potentially invalid or harmful data, which can result in logical errors or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Add input validation checks to confirm that the provided integers meet the expected criteria or constraints of the application's context.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Implicit conversions in numeric operations could lead to data loss or precision errors, particularly when handling large values.
Solution: Ensure explicit type casting or use of appropriate numeric types when performing operations that might lead to precision loss or data truncation.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Multiply two positive integers

Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two positive integers. It ensures that the method correctly multiplies two positive values.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two positive integer variables, `a` and `b`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check if the result is equal to the expected product of `a` and `b`.

Validation:  
The assertion verifies that the product of two positive integers is calculated correctly. This is fundamental for ensuring the method handles standard multiplication cases correctly.

### Scenario 2: Multiply two negative integers

Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test verifies the multiplication of two negative integers to ensure the method handles negative inputs correctly and returns a positive result.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two negative integer variables, `a` and `b`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check if the result is the positive product of the absolute values of `a` and `b`.

Validation:  
The assertion checks that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive outcome, adhering to mathematical rules. It's crucial for confirming the method's accuracy with negative inputs.

### Scenario 3: Multiply a positive integer and a negative integer

Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveAndNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test ensures that multiplying a positive integer by a negative integer yields the correct negative result.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define a positive integer variable `a` and a negative integer variable `b`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check if the result is the negative product of the absolute value of `a` and `b`.

Validation:  
This test confirms that the product of a positive and a negative integer is negative, which is vital for correct arithmetic operations in applications.

### Scenario 4: Multiply by zero

Details:  
TestName: multiplyByZero  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of any integer with zero. According to mathematical principles, any number multiplied by zero should result in zero.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define an integer variable `a` and set another integer `b` to zero.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check if the result is zero.

Validation:  
The assertion ensures that multiplying by zero correctly results in zero, which is a fundamental property of multiplication.

### Scenario 5: Multiply maximum integer values

Details:  
TestName: multiplyMaxIntValues  
Description: This test verifies the behavior when multiplying the maximum integer values, checking for potential overflow issues.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integers `a` and `b`, both set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check the behavior or result, possibly catching any arithmetic exceptions.

Validation:  
This test is critical for understanding how the method handles overflow situations, which can be essential for robustness in financial or scientific calculations.

### Scenario 6: Multiply minimum integer values

Details:  
TestName: multiplyMinIntValues  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two minimum integer values (`Integer.MIN_VALUE`), ensuring correct handling of underflow scenarios.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integers `a` and `b`, both set to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check the behavior or result, focusing on handling potential underflow.

Validation:  
This test assesses the method's behavior under extreme negative multiplication scenarios, important for applications requiring high precision and reliability.
