================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) can lead to an integer overflow if the product of 'a' and 'b' exceeds the maximum value that an int type can store, potentially leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: To mitigate this risk, consider checking the values of 'a' and 'b' before performing the multiplication, or use a data type with a larger range, such as long, if the values can be large. Additionally, consider using Java's Math.multiplyExact(int a, int b) which throws ArithmeticException on overflow.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Implicit conversion in numeric calculations can lead to loss of precision or incorrect calculations. In the given method, there is a risk if the method is modified to handle different numeric types without proper handling.
Solution: Ensure that when performing operations involving different numeric types, explicit type casting is used and handled carefully to avoid precision loss or errors. Use Java's type-specific methods for calculations, such as Math.addExact(), Math.subtractExact(), etc., to handle overflows.

Vulnerability: General Code Quality and Maintainability
Issue: The code lacks proper formatting, which can lead to reduced readability and increased maintenance effort. The method declaration and return statement are on the same line.
Solution: Format the code according to Java coding standards. Use proper line breaks and indentation to enhance readability and maintainability. Tools like Checkstyle, PMD, or SonarQube can automate this process and ensure coding standards are met.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Multiply two positive integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two positive integers to ensure the method correctly computes the product.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up two positive integers, e.g., 5 and 8.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 40.  
Validation:  
The assertion confirms that the product of 5 and 8 is correctly calculated as 40. This test validates the basic arithmetic functionality of the method for positive numbers.

### Scenario 2: Multiply two negative integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two negative integers to verify that the method handles negative inputs correctly.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up two negative integers, e.g., -3 and -7.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 21.  
Validation:  
The assertion checks that the product of -3 and -7 is correctly calculated as 21. This test ensures that the method correctly computes the product of negative numbers, where multiplying two negatives yields a positive.

### Scenario 3: Multiply a positive and a negative integer
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveAndNegative  
Description: To test the multiplication result of one positive and one negative integer to ensure correct sign handling in the output.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up a positive integer 4 and a negative integer -5.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is -20.  
Validation:  
This test verifies that the method correctly handles different signs, resulting in a negative product, which is critical for correct arithmetic operations in applications.

### Scenario 4: Multiply by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyByZero  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of any number by zero to confirm that the method adheres to the mathematical property that any number multiplied by zero is zero.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up an integer 34 and zero.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 0.  
Validation:  
This test ensures that the method correctly implements the zero property of multiplication, which is fundamental in arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 5: Multiply zero by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyZeroByZero  
Description: To verify that the multiplication of zero by zero correctly returns zero.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up zero for both integers.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 0.  
Validation:  
This test confirms that the method handles the case of zero multiplied by zero correctly, reinforcing the zero property in multiplication.

### Scenario 6: Multiply maximum integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyMaxIntegers  
Description: To test the multiplication of two maximum integer values to check for any integer overflow issues.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up two integers with the maximum integer value (Integer.MAX_VALUE).  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Typically, expect an overflow resulting in a value that is not merely the square of Integer.MAX_VALUE, handle according to language specifics.  
Validation:  
This test checks the behavior under extreme cases and is crucial for understanding how the method handles integer overflow, which can impact application stability and correctness in high-value computations. This test is particularly important for financial or scientific calculations where large numbers are common.
