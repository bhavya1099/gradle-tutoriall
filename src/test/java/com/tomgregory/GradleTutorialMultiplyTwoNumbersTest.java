================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) can lead to integer overflow if the product of a and b exceeds the maximum value that a 32-bit integer can store.
Solution: Use Java's java.math.BigInteger for operations that could exceed the limits of int or long. Alternatively, validate input values to ensure they are within a safe range before performing multiplication.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Lack of input validation allows for the method to process any integers, including negative values, which might not be intended and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in business logic.
Solution: Implement input validation to check the appropriateness of the values of a and b. For instance, ensuring non-negative integers if the business logic requires such constraints.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Multiply two positive integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two positive integers to ensure the method correctly computes the product.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up two positive integers, e.g., 5 and 8.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 40.  
Validation:  
The assertion confirms that the product of 5 and 8 is correctly calculated as 40. This test validates the basic arithmetic functionality of the method for positive numbers.

### Scenario 2: Multiply two negative integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two negative integers to verify that the method handles negative values correctly and returns a positive result.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up two negative integers, e.g., -3 and -7.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 21.  
Validation:  
The assertion checks that the product of -3 and -7 is computed as 21, demonstrating that the method correctly handles negative values and the multiplication rules for negative numbers.

### Scenario 3: Multiply a positive integer and a negative integer
Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveAndNegativeNumbers  
Description: To test the multiplication result of one positive and one negative integer, ensuring the method returns a negative result.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up a positive integer, e.g., 6, and a negative integer, e.g., -4.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is -24.  
Validation:  
The assertion verifies that multiplying a positive by a negative integer results in a negative product, confirming correct arithmetic processing of mixed sign multiplication.

### Scenario 4: Multiply by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyByZero  
Description: Test to ensure that any number multiplied by zero results in zero, as per the multiplication principle.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up an integer, e.g., 9, and zero.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these values.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 0.  
Validation:  
The assertion confirms that multiplying any number by zero yields zero, which is a fundamental rule of arithmetic and critical for ensuring correctness in calculations involving zero.

### Scenario 5: Multiply zero by zero
Details:  
TestName: multiplyZeroByZero  
Description: Test the multiplication of zero by zero to ensure the method handles this specific case correctly.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up zero and zero.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these values.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 0.  
Validation:  
The assertion ensures that zero multiplied by zero is zero, a basic multiplication rule, and verifies that the method correctly handles this edge case.

### Scenario 6: Multiply two very large integers
Details:  
TestName: multiplyLargeNumbers  
Description: Tests the multiplication of two large integers to check for any integer overflow issues.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set up two large integers, e.g., 1000000 and 2000000.  
Act: Invoke the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Assert that the result is 2000000000000.  
Validation:  
This test is significant to check that the method can handle large values without causing integer overflow, ensuring the application's reliability with high-range integer calculations.
