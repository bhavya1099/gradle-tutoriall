================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) can lead to integer overflow if the product of a and b exceeds the maximum value that a Java int can store.
Solution: Consider checking the values of a and b before multiplication or use a data type with a larger range, such as long or BigInteger, to handle larger numbers safely.

Vulnerability: CWE-730: OWASP Top Ten A1:2017-Injection
Issue: Without context on how the inputs are handled before being passed to multiplyTwoNumbers, there's a risk that user input could be improperly sanitized, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that any user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in the method. Consider using built-in security features of frameworks and libraries to handle input safely.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Implicit or explicit incorrect type conversion before calling multiplyTwoNumbers could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Explicitly handle type conversions and validate the logic to ensure that the types are correctly managed. Implement error handling to manage unexpected or incorrect input types.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Multiply two positive integers

Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two positive integers. It ensures that the method correctly multiplies two positive values.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two positive integer variables, `a` and `b`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check if the result is equal to the expected product of `a` and `b`.

Validation:  
The assertion verifies that the product of two positive integers is calculated correctly. This is significant as it validates the basic functionality of multiplication in the method.

### Scenario 2: Multiply two negative integers

Details:  
TestName: multiplyNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of two negative integers. It validates that the method properly calculates the product of negative values.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two negative integer variables, `a` and `b`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check if the result is the positive product of their absolute values.

Validation:  
The assertion confirms that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product, adhering to the rules of arithmetic operations, and confirms the method's accuracy in such scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Multiply a positive integer and a negative integer

Details:  
TestName: multiplyPositiveWithNegative  
Description: This test checks the multiplication result of one positive and one negative integer. It ensures the method correctly handles different signs.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define a positive integer `a` and a negative integer `b`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these integers.  
Assert: Check if the result is the negative product of their absolute values.

Validation:  
The assertion ensures that the product of a positive and a negative integer is negative, which is crucial for verifying the correctness of multiplication involving mixed signs.

### Scenario 4: Multiply by zero

Details:  
TestName: multiplyByZero  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of any integer with zero. It ensures that the method returns zero, adhering to the mathematical property that any number multiplied by zero is zero.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define an integer `a` and set `b` to zero.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these values.  
Assert: Check if the result is zero.

Validation:  
The assertion verifies that multiplying any number by zero results in zero, which is a fundamental aspect of multiplication. This test is significant as it checks for correct behavior in edge cases involving zero.

### Scenario 5: Multiply maximum integers

Details:  
TestName: multiplyMaxIntegers  
Description: This test checks the multiplication of the maximum integer values. It tests the method's behavior under potential overflow conditions.

Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integers `a` and `b` with the value `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.  
Act: Call the `multiplyTwoNumbers` method with these values.  
Assert: Check if the result handles overflow as expected or throws an appropriate exception.

Validation:  
The assertion checks how the method handles potential integer overflow, which is critical for ensuring robustness in mathematical calculations in high-value scenarios.
